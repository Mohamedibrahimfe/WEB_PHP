    </h1>
    <div class="first">
        <p class="a">
            is an Egyptian diplomat and politician with a secular liberal background. He won the Nobel Prize in 2005
            while working at the International Atomic Energy Agency and as its director. It is an organization of the
            National Association for Change.

            In particular, Baradei works on a different concern for the Constitution Party, which aims, according to the
            party's definition, to unite philosophical political forces that believe in public freedom and the civility
            of the state, in order to protect the principles and goals of the January 25 Revolution.

            Leader since December 5, 2012 of the National Protection Front, an alliance of the most prominent leaders of
            the National Guard according to the decision of the then President of the Republic, Mohamed Morsi.

            After the 2013 coup in Egypt, which came after demonstrations by the Egyptian opposition, ElBaradei was one
            of the distinguished people to assume the position of Egyptian Prime Minister. On July 9, 2013, Interim
            President Adly Mansour issued a decree decreeing that Muhammad Al-Barrak be named Vice President of the
            Republic for Foreign Relations. ElBaradei confirmed to the German magazine "Der Spiegel" that the army was
            not able to remove Morsi through a military coup, but rather through a popular demand. He said, "Without
            removing Morsi, we would have become a fascist state." We denied our attempt to provoke power again, and
            held the Brotherhood responsible for the violence due to their inflammatory rhetoric.

            On August 14, 2013, the company resigned from its ideas and stopped forcibly holding sit-ins by Morsi
