            <h2>His Achievements</h2>
            <br>
            <p>
                Graduated from the Military Academy in 1938 as Second Lieutenant and served in Manqabad, south of Egypt.
                On January 6, 1946, he was imprisoned in Cairo prison since he was accused of being an accomplice in the
                murder of Amin Othman, the Minister of Finance.
                In 1948, he was acquitted.
                In 1950, he returned to the Military and joined the Free Officers Movement in 1951.
                He delivered the announcement of the Revolution's onset and assumed many positions, such as the
                Editor-in-Chief of Al-Gomhuria newspaper, the President of the National Assembly (the Parliament) and the
                Secretary-General of International Islamic Conference.
                He was elected President of the Federal National Assembly in 1960 and was appointed Chairman of the
                Afro-Asian Solidarity Council in 1961.
                Gamal Abdel Nasser appointed him Vice-President in 1969.
                Following Nasser’s Death, Al-Sadat became the acting president.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
            He was elected President of the Republic after the referendum result was announced on October 17, 1970.
            He made the historic decision of crossing the Suez Canal in October 1973.
            On June 5, 1975 he reopened the Suez Canal for global navigation.
            He established Port Said Free Zone as a start for Egypt to enter the era of economic openness.
            He also established many new cities outside Cairo.
            In 1977, he made his wise, courageous and world-shaking decision: visiting Jerusalem to grant peace as a
            gift to his people and his enemy at the same time.
            By doing so, he pushed the peace process between Egypt and Israel.
            In 1978, he founded the National Democratic Party and assumed its presidency.
            He wrote several books, including: “Qisssat Al-Thawrah Kamilah” (The Full Story of the Revolution), “Safhat
            Mag-hula mn Al-Thawra” (Unkown Pages from the Revolution,” “Ya Walady, Haza `mak Gamal”) (My Son, This is
            Your Uncle Gamal) and (“El-Bahth `n Al-Zat” Soul Searching).
            He received the Nobel Peace Prize in 1978.
            He was assassinated on October 6, 1981.

                After his release from prison, he worked as a newspaper reviewer for Al-Musawar magazine until December 1948.
                After that, he worked freelance with his friend Hassan Ezzat. In 1950, he returned to his work in the army with the help of his old colleague, Dr. Youssef Rashad, King Farouk’s personal physician.
                In 1951, the founding body of the secret organization in the army was formed, which was later known as the Free Officers Organization, and he joined it. Events in Egypt developed very quickly between 1951 and 1952. 
                The Wafd government canceled the 1936 treaty, after which the famous Cairo fire broke out in January 1952, and the king dismissed the last Ministry of Copper.
                In the spring of 1952, the leadership of the Free Officers Organization prepared for the revolution, and on July 21, Gamal Abdel Nasser sent to him at his unit headquarters in Arish asking him to come to Cairo to contribute to the army’s revolution against the king and the British. 
                He contributed to the revolution, and broadcast the revolution's statement with his voice.
                 He was entrusted with the task of carrying the document of abdication of the throne to King Farouk.

                President Sadat signed the Camp David Accords with Israel
                On November 19, 1977, President Sadat made his decision, which caused an uproar in the Arab world, by visiting Jerusalem in order to push the wheel of peace between Egypt and Israel. 
                In 1978, he made his trip to the United States of America in order to negotiate the return of the land and achieve peace as a legitimate demand for every country. 
                During this trip, he signed the peace agreement at Camp David under the auspices of US President Jimmy Carter.
                The Camp David Peace Treaty was signed between Egypt and Israel with both US President Jimmy Carter and Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin. 
                The agreement is a framework for negotiation consisting of two agreements, the first a framework for a single peace agreement between Egypt and Israel, and the second specific to principles for comprehensive Arab peace in the West Bank, Gaza Strip, and the Golan.
                The first agreement ended with the signing of the Egyptian-Israeli peace treaty in 1979, after which Israel worked to return the occupied Egyptian lands to Egypt.
                He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize jointly with Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin for their tireless efforts to achieve peace in the Middle East region.
