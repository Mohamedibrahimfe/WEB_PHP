                <h2>Naguib Mahfouz's Literary Journey</h2>

            </div>

            <p>
                Naguib Mahfouz's literary career is intertwined with the history of the modern novel in Egypt and the
                Arab world.
                At the turn of the twentieth century, the Arabic novel took its first steps in a society and culture
                that discovered this literary genre through the translation of European novels from the nineteenth
                century.
                However, for Naguib Mahfouz, a society as strong and ancient as Egyptian society,
                having preserved ancient traditions while modernizing, could absorb and incorporate,
                without fear, some aspects of Western culture. Because this writer listened, above all, in his work, to
                this Egyptian people,
                to their intimate adventures and their history.
                Naguib Mahfouz's novels are characterized by a classic narrative style,
                characterized by a focus on portraying characters and situations in a very realistic way, with an
                emphasis on customs,
                traditions, and social values ​​in Egyptian society, and the accurate embodiment of daily life in Egypt.
                <b>Naguib Mahfouz also uses the style of the internal novel, which allows the reader to view the world
                    through the eyes of a central character in the novel.</b>
                Naguib Mahfouz's style is also characterized by manipulating time and focusing on the changes that occur
                in events and people over time.

                <h2>Early life and education</h2>

            </div>

            <p>
                Mahfouz was born in a lower middle-class Muslim Egyptian family in Old Cairo in 1911.
                <b>The first part of his compound given name was chosen in appreciation of the well-known obstetrician,
                    Naguib Pasha Mahfouz</b>,
                who oversaw his difficult birth.<b> Mahfouz was the seventh and the youngest child</b>, with four
                brothers and two sisters, all of them much older than him.
                (Experientially, he grew up an "only child".) The family lived in two popular districts of Cairo: first,
                in the Bayt al-Qadi neighborhood in the Gamaleya quarter in the old city,
                from where they moved in 1924 to Abbaseya, then a new Cairo suburb north of the old city, locations that
                would provide the backdrop for many of Mahfouz's later writings.
                His father, Abdel-Aziz Ibrahim,<b> whom Mahfouz described as having been "old-fashioned"</b>, was a
                civil servant, and Mahfouz eventually followed in his footsteps in 1934.
                <b>Mahfouz's mother, Fatimah, was the daughter of Mustafa Qasheesha, an Al-Azhar sheikh</b>, and
                although illiterate herself, took the boy Mahfouz on numerous excursions to cultural locations
                such as the Egyptian Museum and the Pyramids.
            </p>

            <h2></h2>
            <p>
                The Mahfouz family were devout Muslims and Mahfouz had a strict Islamic upbringing.
                In an interview, he elaborated on the stern religious climate at home during his childhood.
                He stated, "You would never have thought that an artist would emerge from that family.

                The Egyptian Revolution of 1919 had a strong effect on Mahfouz, although he was at the time only seven
                years old.
                From the window he saw British soldiers firing at the demonstrators in an effort to disperse
                them.According to Mahfouz, "You could say that <b> the one thing which most shook the security of my
                    childhood was the 1919 revolution"</b>, he later said.
                <b>In his early years, Mahfouz read extensively and was influenced by Hafiz Najib, Taha Hussein and
                    Salama Moussa</b>, the Fabian intellectual.
                After completing his secondary education, Mahfouz was admitted in 1930 to the Egyptian University (now
                Cairo University),
                where he studied philosophy, graduating in 1934. By 1936, having spent a year working on an M.A. in
                philosophy, he decided to discontinue his studies and become a professional writer.
                <b>He published his first work in Al Majalla Al Jadida, a magazine started by Salama Musa in 1929.</b>
                Mahfouz then worked as a journalist for Arrissalah,
                and contributed short stories to Al-Hilal and Al-Ahram.

            <h2>Civil service</h2>
            <p>
                After receiving his bachelor's degree in philosophy from Cairo University in 1934, Mahfouz joined the
                Egyptian civil service,
                where he continued to work in various positions and ministries until retirement in 1971.
                He served first as a clerk at Cairo University, then, in 1938, in the Ministry of Islamic Endowments
                (Awqaf) as parliamentary secretary to the Minister of Islamic Endowments.
                In 1945, he requested a transfer to the al-Ghuri Mausoleum library, where he interviewed residents of
                his childhood neighborhood as part of the "Good Loans Project".
                In the 1950s, he worked as Director of Censorship in the Bureau of Arts, as Director of the Foundation
                for the Support of the Cinema, and finally as a consultant to the Ministry of Culture.

            </div>

            <p>
                Mahfouz published 34 novels, over 350 short stories, dozens of screenplays, and five plays over a
                70-year career.
                Possibly his most famous work, The Cairo Trilogy, depicts the lives of three generations of different
                families in Cairo from World War
                I until after the 1952 military coup that overthrew King Farouk. He was a board member of the publisher
                Dar el-Ma'aref.
                Many of his novels were serialized in Al-Ahram, and his writings also appeared in his weekly column,
                "Point of View". Before the Nobel Prize only a few of his novels had appeared in the West.

        <section class="text7">

            <h2>Writing style and themes</h2>
            <p>
                Most of Mahfouz's early works were set in Cairo. Abath Al-Aqdar (Mockery of the Fates) (1939),
                Rhadopis (1943), and Kifah Tibah (The Struggle of Thebes) (1944) were historical novels written as part
                of a larger unfulfilled 30-novel project.
                Inspired by Sir Walter Scott (1771–1832), Mahfouz planned to cover the entire history of Egypt in a
                series of books. However,
                following the third volume, his interest shifted to current settings and issues, as well as the
                psychological impact of social change on ordinary people.
            </p>

            <p>
                Mahfouz's works often deal with Egypt's development during the 20th century, and combined intellectual
                and cultural influences from both East and West.
                <b>His own exposure to foreign literature began in his youth with the enthusiastic consumption of
                    Western detective stories, Russian classics, and modernist writers as Marcel Proust, Franz Kafka and
                    James Joyce.</b>
                Mahfouz's stories are almost always set in the heavily populated urban quarters of Cairo, where his
                characters, usually ordinary people, try to cope with the modernization of society and the temptations
                of Western values.
                <br>
                <b> Mahfouz's central work in the 1950s was the Cairo Trilogy, which he completed before the July
                    Revolution.
                    The novels were titled with the street names Palace Walk, Palace of Desire, and Sugar Street.</b>
                Mahfouz set the story in the parts of Cairo where he grew up. The novels depict the life of the
                patriarch el-Sayyed Ahmed Abdel Gawad and his family over three generations,
                from World War I to the 1950s, when King Farouk I was overthrown.<b> Mahfouz stopped writing for some
                    years after finishing the trilogy.</b>
            </p>

        <section class="text7">
            <p>
                His 1966 novel Tharthara Fawq Al-Nīl (Adrift on the Nile) is one of his most popular works.
                It was later made into a film called Chitchat on the Nile during the régime of Anwar al-Sadat.
                The story criticizes the decadence of Egyptian society during the Nasser era. It was banned by Sadat to
                avoid provoking Egyptians who still loved former president Nasser.
                Copies of the banned book were hard to find prior to the late 1990s.

                The Children of Gebelawi (1959, also known as Children of the Alley) one of Mahfouz's best known works,
                portrayed the patriarch Gebelaawi and his children, average Egyptians living the lives of Cain and Abel,
                Moses, Jesus, and Mohammed.
                Gebelawi builds a mansion in an oasis in the middle of a barren desert; his estate becomes the scene of
                a family feud that continues for generations.
                "Whenever someone is depressed, suffering or humiliated, he points to the mansion at the top of the
                alley at the end opening out to the desert, and says sadly,
                'That is our ancestor's house, we are all his children, and we have a right to his property. Why are we
                starving? What have we done?'"
                The book was banned throughout the Arab world except in Lebanon until 2006 when it was first published
                in Egypt.
                The work was prohibited because of its alleged blasphemy through the allegorical portrayal of God and
                the monotheistic Abrahamic faiths of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam.

                In the 1960s, Mahfouz further developed the theme that humanity is moving further away from God in his
                existentialist novels.
                In The Thief and the Dogs (1961) he depicted the fate of a Marxist thief who has been released from
                prison and plans revenge.
            </p>

            <p>
                In the 1960s and 1970s Mahfouz began to construct his novels more freely and often used interior
                monologues.
                In Miramar (1967) he employed a form of multiple First-person narratives. Four narrators, among them a
                Socialist and a Nasserite opportunist, represent different political views.
                In the center of the story is an attractive servant girl. In Arabian Nights and Days (1979) and in The
                Journey of Ibn Fatouma (1983) he drew on traditional Arabic narratives as subtexts.
                Akhenaten: Dweller in Truth (1985) deals with conflict between old and new religious truths.

                <b> Many of his novels were first published in serialized form, including Children of Gebelawi and Midaq
                    Alley which was also adapted into a Mexican film starring Salma Hayek called El callejón de los
                    milagros.</b>

                <h2>Naguib Mahfouz's American Reception</h2>

            </div>

            <p>
                Mahfouz's translated works received praise from American critics:

                "The alleys, the houses, the palaces and mosques and the people who live among them are evoked as
                vividly in Mahfouz's work as the streets of London were conjured by Dickens."<b> —Newsweek</b>

                "Throughout Naguib Mahfouz's fiction there is a pervasive sense of metaphor, of a literary artist who is
                using his fiction to speak directly and unequivocally to the condition of his country.
                His work is imbued with love for Egypt and its people, but it is also utterly honest and
                unsentimental."<b> —Washington Post</b>

                "Mahfouz's work is freshly nuanced and hauntingly lyrical. The Nobel Prize acknowledges the universal
                significance of [his] fiction."<b> —Los Angeles Times</b>

                "Mr. Mahfouz embodied the essence of what makes the bruising, raucous, chaotic human anthill of Cairo
                possible." <b>—The Economist</b>

            <h2>Nobel Prize for Literature</h2>

            <p>
                <b>Mahfouz was awarded the 1988 Nobel Prize in Literature, the only Arab writer to have won the
                    award.</b>
                Shortly after winning the prize Mahfouz was quoted as saying:

                <b>The Nobel Prize has given me, for the first time in my life, the feeling that my literature could be
                    appreciated on an international level.
                    The Arab world also won the Nobel with me. I believe that international doors have opened, and that
                    from now on,
                    literate people will consider Arab literature also. We deserve that recognition.</b>

                The Swedish letter to Mahfouz praised his "rich and complex work":

                [It] invites us to reconsider the fundamental things in life. Themes like the nature of time and love,
                society and norms,
                knowledge and faith recur in a variety of situations and are presented in thought-provoking, evocative,
                and clearly daring ways.
                And the poetic quality of your prose can be felt across the language barrier. In the prize citation you
                are credited with the forming of an Arabian narrative art that applies to all mankind.

                <b>Because Mahfouz found traveling to Sweden difficult at his age, he did not attend the award
                    ceremony.</b>

                <h2>Personal life</h2>

            </div>

            <p>
                <b> Mahfouz remained a bachelor until age 43</b> because he believed that, with its numerous
                restrictions and limitations,
                marriage would hamper his literary future. "I was afraid of marriage especially when I saw how busy my
                brothers and sisters were with social events because of it.
                This one went to visit people, that one invited people. I had the impression that married life would
                take up all my time.
                I saw myself drowning in visits and parties. No freedom.

                However, in 1954, he quietly married a Coptic Orthodox woman from Alexandria, Atiyyatallah Ibrahim, with
                whom he had two daughters, Fatima and Umm Kalthum.
                The couple initially lived on a houseboat in the Agouza section of Cairo on the west bank of the Nile,
                then moved to an apartment along the river in the same area.
                Mahfouz avoided public exposure, especially inquiries into his private life, which might have become, as
                he put it, "a silly topic in journals and radio programs.

                Mahfouz distinctly did not like to travel. Belgrade was one of the few cities to which he gladly went
                and he expressed great respect for Serbia.
