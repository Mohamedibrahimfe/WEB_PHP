            By doing so, he pushed the peace process between Egypt and Israel.
            In 1978, he founded the National Democratic Party and assumed its presidency.
            He wrote several books, including: “Qisssat Al-Thawrah Kamilah” (The Full Story of the Revolution), “Safhat
            Mag-hula mn Al-Thawra” (Unkown Pages from the Revolution,” “Ya Walady, Haza `mak Gamal” (My Son, This is

            On November 19, 1977, President Sadat made his decision, which caused an uproar in the Arab world, by
            visiting Jerusalem in order to push the wheel of peace between Egypt and Israel.
            In 1978, he made his trip to the United States of America in order to negotiate the return of the land and
            achieve peace as a legitimate demand for every country.
            During this trip, he signed the peace agreement at Camp David under the auspices of US President Jimmy
            Carter.
            The Camp David Peace Treaty was signed between Egypt and Israel with both US President Jimmy Carter and
            Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin.
            The agreement is a framework for negotiation consisting of two agreements, the first a framework for a
            single peace agreement between Egypt and Israel, and the second specific to principles for comprehensive
            Arab peace in the West Bank, Gaza Strip, and the Golan.
            The first agreement ended with the signing of the Egyptian-Israeli peace treaty in 1979, after which Israel
            worked to return the occupied Egyptian lands to Egypt.
            He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize jointly with Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin for their tireless
            efforts to achieve peace in the Middle EasT
