                After completing his PhD, Zewail did postdoctoral research at the University of California, Berkeley, supervised by Charles B. Harris. he was awarded a faculty appointment at the California Institute of Technology in 1976,
                and eventually became the first Linus Pauling Chair in Chemical Physics there.He became a naturalized citizen of the United States on March 5, 1982. 
                Zewail was the director of the Physical Biology Center for Ultrafast Science and Technology at the California Institute of Technology.
                Zewail was nominated and participated in President Barack Obama's Presidential Council of Advisors on Science and Technology (PCAST),
                an advisory group of the nation's leading scientists and engineers to advise the President and Vice President and formulate policy in the areas of science,

             Zewail's key work was a pioneer of femtochemistry.
             the study of chemical reactions across femtoseconds. Using a rapid ultrafast laser technique (consisting of ultrashort laser flashes), 
             the technique allows the description of reactions on very short time scales - short enough to analyse transition states in selected chemical reactions.
             Zewail became known as the "father of femtochemistry". He also made critical contributions in ultrafast electron diffraction,
             which uses short electron pulses rather than light pulses to study chemical reaction dynamics.

                Visualizing Molecular Dynamics
                His techniques allowed scientists to directly observe the motion of atoms and molecules during chemical processes, revolutionizing our understanding of reaction mechanisms.

                Envoy program as part of a "new beginning between the United States and Muslims around the world.
                In January 2010, Ahmed Zewail, Elias Zerhouni, and Bruce Alberts became the first US science envoys to Islam, 
                visiting Muslim-majority countries from North Africa to Southeast Asia.
                When asked about rumors that he might contest the 2011 Egyptian presidential election,
                Ahmed Zewail said:
                <h4>
                  "I am a frank man... I have no political ambition,

             Zewail was later mentioned as a respected figure working as an intermediary between the military regime ruling after Mubarak's resignation,
              and <b> revolutionary youth groups such as the April 6 Youth Movement and young supporters of Mohamed ElBaradei.</b>
              He played a critical role during this time as described by Egyptian Media.

            <h2>His interest in the Arab world and Egypt:</h2>
            <br>

            <p>
              Ahmed Zewail's interests were directed towards his country, Egypt in particular, but he did not neglect his duty towards his Arabism and clarifying the role of the Arabs in enriching all fields of science.
              He often spoke in his speeches and articles about the great history of the Arabs in the development of science, and their being the basis of many sciences and knowledge. 
              He also encouraged his countrymen to strive for distinction and excellence again by investing in education, and primarily scientific research, which prompted him to strive to build Zewail City for Science and Technology in 2013 AD, 
              so that this edifice would be a suitable environment to cover the areas necessary for the development of Egyptian society. 
              So that this edifice would be a suitable environment to cover the areas necessary for the development of Egyptian society. 
              Zewail, who combined Eastern and Western cultures and their ideas, believed that using “soft power” in education, diplomacy, and economic development was more feasible and less costly than using force, military aggression, or foreign aid.
              Zewail called for education as a basic right that must be obtained because it is the basis of ability and excellence.
               He called for overcoming the barriers of bureaucracy that made education exclusive to a certain class of people, and he looked forward to the time when all of Egypt’s gifted children would obtain a broad education that would develop their talents and lead them. 
               towards development, while higher education is limited to those who deserve it. I also believe that achieving a prosperous future for the country is represented by the changes that occur in education, bureaucracy, and internal law.
