                Legacy of Nuclear Nonproliferation El-Baradei's tireless efforts at the IAEA have made him a global champion of nuclear disarmament and nonproliferation.
                Advocate for Democracy His involvement in the Egyptian revolution and continued advocacy for human rights solidify his legacy as a proponent of democracy.
                Lasting Impact Through his work at the IAEA, in international politics, and as a public intellectual, El-Baradei has left an indelible mark on the world.

                ElBaradei's work does not only concentrate on nuclear verification. Another very important aspect is development through nuclear technology. 
                In 2004, ElBaradei sponsored a comprehensive global initiativeâ€”the Programme of Action for Cancer Therapy (PACT)--to fight cancer. In one of his statements, 
                ElBaradei said: "A silent crisis in cancer treatment persists in developing countries and is intensifying every year. 
                At least 50 to 60 percent of cancer victims can benefit from radiotherapy, but most developing countries do not have enough radiotherapy machines or sufficient numbers of specialized doctors and other health professionals.
                " In the first year of operation, PACT provided cancer-treatment capacity in seven member states, using the IAEA's share of the 2005 Nobel Peace Prize.
                In his speech to the 2008 General Conference, ElBaradei said that "development activities remain central to our work.
                Our resources have long been insufficient to keep pace with requests for support, and we have increasingly made use of partnerships with other organizations, regional collaborations and country-to-country support. 
                I again emphasize that technical cooperation is not a bargaining chip, part of a political 'balance' between the development and safeguards activities of the agency.
